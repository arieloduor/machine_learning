# machine_learning

A minimal C Machine Learning Library

Not vectorized but might add vectorization support in the future

covers Linear Regression,Lasso Regression,K-Nearest Neighbours { Regression and Classification },Logistic Regression

Might add more algorithms depending on my needs

The API has a python like ml feel
